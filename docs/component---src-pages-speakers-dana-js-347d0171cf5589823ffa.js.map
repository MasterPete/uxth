These gaps explained\n            why it’s harder than it should be to vote in the U.S. and showed\n            that policies meant to make things better had unintended\n            consequences that actually make it worse.\n          </Content>\n          <BlueContent>Takeaways from this talk:</BlueContent>\n          <ListWrapper>\n            <ListItem>\n              A solid understanding of the gradual, continuous work it takes to\n              work on complex design problems\n            </ListItem>\n            <ListItem>\n              Why 8 participants is not enough to tell the full story of an\n              experience\n            </ListItem>\n            <ListItem>\n              It’s not about the map, it’s about what we learn in making the map\n            </ListItem>\n          </ListWrapper>\n        </>\n      ),\n\n      workshop: (\n        <>\n          <Topic>\n            Design for Delight — Transforming Your Designs From Good To Great\n          </Topic>\n          <Content>\n            A good design is usable, useful, and effective.

(She’s the co-author of Handbook of Usability\n            Testing Second Edition.) Usability testing is a great tool for\n            identifying frustrating points in a design, but what happens after\n            that? She set out to understand what you do after you’ve eliminated\n            all of the frustration with a design — surely, there must be\n            something beyond satisfaction. Her delight framework goes beyond\n            tickling the fancies of users (whatever that means) to looking at\n            how to design for pleasure, flow, and meaning.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Resting on her laurels after working for President Obama at the U.S.\n            Digital Service (2014-16), Dana is a co-founder of the Center for\n            Civic Design with Whitney Quesenbery, where her team works to ensure\n            that every interaction people have with government is efficient,\n            effective, and pleasant.\n          </Content>\n        </>\n      ),\n    }}\n  />\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
