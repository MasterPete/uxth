This grew their\n            business. Many large companies that have been around for decades, or\n            even newer startups that have found some stability, fall into a\n            dangerous place called “The Build Trap”. They continue building\n            feature after feature, without stopping to validate it’s what\n            customer truly want and need. This is due in part to poor\n            understanding of Product Strategy, Product Management, and how to\n            manage teams. In order to get out of “The Build Trap”, businesses\n            need to restructure their thinking to focus on finding value for the\n            user through experimentation to achieve business goals.\n          </Content>\n        </>\n      ),\n      biography: (\n        <>\n          <Topic>Biography</Topic>\n          <Content>\n            Melissa Perri is a Product Management CEO, teacher, and author.\n            Melissa's day job is as the CEO of Produx Labs, a firm that helps\n            growth stage and enterprise companies scale their product\n            organizations.
