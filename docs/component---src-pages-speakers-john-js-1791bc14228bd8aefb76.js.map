Are we sprinting—faster\n            and faster—to nowhere In particular? Is “how do you do UX with\n            Agile“ perhaps the wrong question?\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Design has always been about iteration, subtraction, addition,\n            experimentation, and observation. That process defines who we are as\n            designers. With manufacturing, there was the point-of-no-return, the\n            date our design was “finalised“ and something got sent off to the\n            manufacturer (or press). With software as a service (SaaS), however,\n            we have no such constraints. We don’t need to operate feature\n            factories, yet somehow we often do. So, let’s fix that!\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            In this talk, we are going to get into the nitty-gritty of treating\n            product development as an act of continuous design; not Agile. We’ll\n            draw on design traditions, and explore how they heavily overlap with\n            how we are able to work with our teams. And we’ll consider a reality\n            where products and features are temporary solutions to long-standing\n            problems (and what that means for design).\n          </Content>\n        </>\n      ),\n\n      workshop: (\n        <>\n          <Topic>\n            Making Sense of Product Development (For Designers and Product\n            Managers)\n          </Topic>\n          <Content>\n            Software product development involves grappling with uncertainty. We\n            do this every day when we focus, prioritize, break work down, and\n            plan how we’ll introduce the product.
